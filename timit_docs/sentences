948	how much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating 
949	it may be hard to decide what this labor is worth but charge something for it 
950	as such it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a message 
951	all too often our language is unduly harsh 
952	that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today 
953	historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations

960	no group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors 
961	the coalition was to prove inadvisable 
962	like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol 
963	however this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever 
964	the dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement 
965	a tsunami is not a single wave but a series 
966	a sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll 
967	he not only knew soldiering but mathematics history and literature as well 
968	along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered 
969	what had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick 
970	we flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash 
971	then off again rushing to keep up 
972	we send shovels cement nails and corrugated iron for roofs 
973	then came coconuts eggs and rice wine 
974	then we were off again 
975	but our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery 
976	now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us 
977	next he addressed himself to our souls 
978	for girls the overprotection is far more pervasive 
979	almost everybody in the senior class is married students say dogmatically 
980	bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak 
981	a chaw of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing 
982	tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound 
983	rabies were cured or prevented by madstones which the pioneer wore or carried 
984	since a fall or blow might have caused it a cold pack was usually first aid 
985	bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests 
986	ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing 
987	for wasp stings onion juice obtained by scraping an onion gave quick relief 
988	a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment but it did the job 
989	the situation involved some political perils 
990	and these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today 
991	she had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed 
992	they were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters 
993	he met nobody he knew on this walk 
994	her study of history was persistently pursued 
995	at different times he served as glee club and choir leader and as organist 
996	she served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance 
997	both loved the out of doors including mountain climbing and horseback riding 
998	yet they thrived on it 
999	now the school was indeed bereft 
1000	soon the office work claimed all her time 
1001	oh he'll be a plumber came the answer 
1002	we produce peanut oil but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed 
1003	seeds of soybean cotton corn sesame and rape yield semidrying oils 
1004	palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin

1015	hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed 
1016	to keep 'em scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em was called loose herdin' 
1017	to hold 'em in a compact mass was close herdin' 
1018	cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the winter kill 
1019	them new to the country were referred to as pilgrims 
1020	the cowboy called this breed of cattle magpies 
1021	the cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a milk pitcher 
1022	cows givin' no milk were knowed as strippers 
1023	such an animal was said to be mealynosed 
1024	at the base of the rocky hillside they left their horses and climbed on foot 
1025	nice country to meet a lion in face to face 
1026	careful don't disturb her 
1027	even then if she took one step forward he could catch her 
1028	but now she sank lower to the rock 
1029	her tail no longer lashed 
1030	bring me the firecrackers 
1031	ain't she beauty though 
1032	it was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again 
1033	if dark came they would lose her 
1034	she snarled warningly 
1035	with a whirling jump it could get into gear 
1036	the antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists 
1037	the revised procedure was acclaimed as a long overdue reform 
1038	the courtyard is magnificently decorated 
1039	he has never himself done anything for which to be hated which of us has 
1040	northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury 
1041	brief snips of actual events were shown parades dances street scenes 
1042	time and space have both become cinematic 
1043	not surprisingly this approach did not work 
1044	residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions 
1045	it offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade but asked an indemnity 
1046	these men were without capital or experience 
1047	twenty five the sheik replied 
1048	the library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom 
1049	they understood and teased me a bit about it 
1050	both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail 
1051	northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration 
1052	the social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area 
1053	whatever their faults they are not hypocrites 
1054	a concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment 
1055	internal national responsibility now a truism need not be documented 
1056	can thermonuclear war be set off by accident 
1057	are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster 
1058	readiness exercises are almost continuous 
1059	they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details 
1060	they inhabit a secret world centered on go codes and gold phones 
1061	but what if somebody decides to break it 
1062	vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda 
1063	no question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate 
1064	unless we send out the whole pie their pieces mean nothing 
1065	all three must compare notes and agree to go 
1066	they were chasing a rain cloud 
1067	their gait is impossible to convey in words 
1068	any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done 
1069	perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity 
1070	do you always navigate like this 
1071	two miles northeast then five miles southwest that sort of thing 
1072	there was also a dog a dingo dog 
1073	they'll move around that rock all day following the shade 
1074	he gazed away from us as we approached 
1075	there was also a boomerang elaborately carved 
1076	tiny bodies dropped onto a dry leaf made a pile as big as a small apple 
1077	the odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines 
1078	the smell is sexual but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it 
1079	boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade 
1080	when he was eight he began violin lessons 
1081	our successors will have an easier task 
1082	a new order is thrusting itself into being 
1083	the system works as an impersonal mechanism 
1084	the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve 
1085	he may toss coins he may take slips paper from a grab bag 
1086	then the choreographer must arbitrate 
1087	he must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other 
1088	one wonders about its applicability to people 
1089	perhaps things were even worse then 
1090	but a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating 
1091	solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought 
1092	yet we no longer feel uneasy 
1093	what elements of our behavior are decisive 
1094	american newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic 
1095	they find deep pessimism in them 
1096	he wore a brown knit sport shirt with no tie 
1097	his talk turns to what he calls the mess or sometimes this buzzing confusion 
1098	one can only speak of what is in front of him and that now is simply the mess 
1099	this does not allow the mystery to invade us 
1100	as she goes she herself will be illuminated 
1101	then he thought me more perverse than ever 
1102	the beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates 
1103	their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath rootless and irresponsible 
1104	this girl soon drops the bourgeoisie psychiatrist who disapproves of her life 
1105	what obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk 
1106	everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism 
1107	what one actually remembers is its greenness 
1108	one looked down on a sea of leaves a breaking wave of flower 
1109	a wheel squeaked on a hub was still and squeaked again 
1110	the season between spring and summer belongs to life in its carefree aspect 
1111	how do we define it 
1112	he will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community 
1113	whether historically a fact or not the legend has a certain symbolic value 
1114	why should this be so 
1115	he did not however settle back into acquiescence with things as they were 
1116	each is still glorified as a national hero 
1117	he finds it in utter misery and desolation 
1118	as he had longed to be he became the echo of a saga 
1119	the record teems with romance and adventure 
1120	his tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence 
1121	in either case they do not appreciate the private detective's zeal 
1122	his successors have adopted the opposite alternative 
1123	they also furnish proof that in modern war message sending must be monitored 
1124	let me quote him even more fully for his analysis is important to my theme 
1125	but in every period it has been humanism 
1126	and let me add utopianism also 
1127	we of the liberal led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation 
1128	others invoked technology and common sense 
1129	this group is secularist and their program tends to be technological 
1130	should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us 
1131	but we cannot start off with a clean slate 
1132	no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts 
1133	it can project long range goals for itself 
1134	individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition 
1135	have we not actually developed idea worship 
1136	we scour literature for them here we find stored the wisdom of great minds 
1137	his name became synonymous with cold blooded cruelty 
1138	that doctrine has been accepted by many but has it produced good results 
1139	in time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal black child 
1140	false ideas surfeit another sector of our life 
1141	the stepmother almost without exception has been presented as a cruel ogress 
1142	research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one 
1143	most assuredly ideas are invaluable 
1144	we would establish no censorship 
1145	ironically enough in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury 
1146	we knew that it was as reassurance the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature 
1147	civilization is what man has made of himself 
1148	change involves the displacement of form 
1149	the response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing 
1150	with those paintings of big constructions crashing down he felt he could stop 
1151	for what do the utopians labor 
1152	you could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving quality of maturity 
1153	in an ideological argument the participants tend to thump the table 
1154	only incomplete imperfect things move towards what they lack 
1155	his problem concerns longitudes latitudes and angular velocities 
1156	this is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy 
1157	but considered within technical astronomy a different pattern can be traced 
1158	geocentricism per se 
1159	cut off every building at the seventh floor 
1160	neither his appetites his exacerbations nor his despair were kin to yours 
1161	with each song he gave verbal footnotes 
1162	two things contribute to his popularity 
1163	no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be imagined 
1164	otherwise the outlook could be dark indeed 
1165	the continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process 
1166	in the course of its inquiry it took testimony from only seven witnesses 
1167	we have nothing to hide under a bushel 
1168	it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact 
1169	they despised foreigners 
1170	he has also an extraordinary conscience 
1171	nor were his manners barbaric 
1172	he was busy he said in having someone submit to a monkey gland operation 
1173	he brought her shawls 
1174	it had a teeny envelope tied to its wrist 
1175	diversity of perception yes diversity of fact yes 
1176	to some extent predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments 
1177	in some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality 
1178	many selections are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal 
1179	what shall these effects be 
1180	what factors condition the degree of realization at various times and places 
1181	properly used the present book is an excellent instrument of enlightenment 
1182	let us differentiate a few of these ideas 
1183	it is the obverse of triviality shallowness emotional anaesthesia 
1184	there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary 
1185	his technique is genuinely masterful 
1186	questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship activities 
1187	he advised immediate hospitalization 
1188	maybe they will take us 
1189	eight field guns were captured in position 
1190	next best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action 
1191	all chance of fulfilling my destiny is over 
1192	so of course he stayed put 
1193	he'd collared one of his generals in public 
1194	woe betide the interviewee if he answered vaguely 
1195	passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark 
1196	he had accordingly cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature 
1197	transparent look waxy skin could well be uremia 
1198	it is awe inspiring 
1199	they close sometime after eight 
1200	let him become honest and they discard him 
1201	we hope that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle him to credit 
1202	his artistic accomplishments guaranteed him entry into any social gathering 
1203	instead of that he was engulfed by bedlam 
1204	the purchasers rejected the order in two letters written in vigorous terms 
1205	but we aren't going to let you give him any 
1206	all about him stood tombstones his own sensitive great hands had fashioned 
1207	but they would reconsider it they assured him if he would rewrite it 
1208	this doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense 
1209	if disobeyed the result is turmoil and chaos 
1210	as we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable 
1211	their basis seems deeper than mere authority 
1212	they are not true because scientists or prophets say they are true 
1213	my own experience has followed simpler lines 
1214	religion thus becomes integrated with life 
1215	this truth that the moral law is natural has other important corollaries 
1216	let us now give some thought to the soul 
1217	only those story tellers will remain who can imitate the style of the virtuous 
1218	poets moreover dwell on human passions 
1219	students' choices of ideal educational goals are not arbitrary or whimsical 
1220	they also want money prestige and security 
1221	conservatism and traditionalism seem implied by what has just been said 
1222	avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as to be a curiosity 
1223	the redcoats ran like rabbits 
1224	this is nevertheless a minority view 
1225	the tragic stage is a platform extending precariously between heaven and hell 
1226	the wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic centre 
1227	from it spokes of order and degree led to the outward rim of the common man 
1228	tragedy presumes such a configuration 
1229	its sphere is that of royal courts dynastic quarrels and vaulting ambitions 
1230	princes and factions clashed in the open street and died on the open scaffold 
1231	and their chroniclers are not the dramatic poets but the prose novelists 
1232	they were not yet prepared to accept it as irremediable 
1233	it made no difference that most evidence points to an opposite conclusion 
1234	but none of this could soothe the exacerbated nerves 
1235	we often say of a person that he looks young for his age or old for his age 
1236	boy you ain't fooling nobody but yourself 
1237	we may say of some unfortunates that they were never young 
1238	how on earth do you manage it 
1239	thus far the advances made have been almost entirely along functional lines 
1240	he is forced to play for little money and must often take another job to live 
1241	in many of his poems death comes by train a strongly evocative visual image 
1242	but it did print good verse and good fiction 
1243	ideas are the thruway to nowhere 
1244	the sculptor looked at him bugeyed and amazed angry 
1245	object a village crossroads 
1246	he was thus an early and spectacular victim 
1247	no poetry no airplanes no dancers 
1248	the trouble is that like many symbols it doesn't seem a very realistic one 
1249	maybe twenty thirty fifty 
1250	evidence that other sources of financing are unavailable must be provided 
1251	only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation 
1252	development requires a long term approach 
1253	most of our aid will go to those nearing self sufficiency 
1254	to honor him is to honor ourselves 
1255	my sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today 
1256	origin of state automobile practices 
1257	forty seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business 
1258	it does not indicate loose management ineffective controls or poor policy 
1259	from this motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data 
1260	unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public 
1261	in two cases airplanes only were indicated 
1262	ten others made no reply 
1263	both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars 
1264	dances alternated with sung or spoken verses 
1265	ballets were used in opera from its beginning 
1266	twenty nine exhibits received awards 
1267	thirty five military and civilian students received laboratory training 
1268	the shutter consists of two parts a fast opening part and a fast closing part 
1269	resistance thermometers 
1270	vapor pressure method 
1271	this has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer 
1272	laboratory astrophysics 
1273	selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation 
1274	atomic energy levels 
1275	blockade is one answer offered by experts 
1276	land based radar would help with this task 
1277	so would radar picket ships 
1278	solid concrete blocks relatively heavy and dense are used for this shelter 
1279	bricks are an alternative 
1280	the shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection 
1281	the same shelter could be built into an embankment or below ground level 
1282	radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation 
1283	living in a shelter the radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first 
1284	a battery powered radio is essential 
1285	family rationing probably will be necessary 
1286	blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule 
1287	a covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet 
1288	a portable electric heater is advisable for shelters in cold climates 
1289	a flame would use up air 
1290	one of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage 
1291	they should live in modest circumstances avoiding all conspicuous consumption 
1292	our aim must be to learn as much as we teach 
1293	these curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data 
1294	if you are a life tenant you deduct allowable depreciation and depletion 
1295	he may get a tax refund 
1296	further research we believe will develop important commercial applications 
1297	at intervals an alumni directory is issued 
1298	between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters 
1299	how well do faculty members govern themselves 
1300	he can for example present significant university wide issues to the senate 
1301	deans can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty 
1302	more often these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data 
1303	a detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper 
1304	it was exposed to a high velocity gas jet 
1305	if they are not ellipsoids the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation 
1306	this viscosity of the material in the drops is of course not negligible 
1307	this is known as conformational entropy 
1308	indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects 
1309	the better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders 
1310	many scouring powders now also contain phosphates 
1311	soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones 
1312	in most cases these soils are taken up as liquids through capillary action 
1313	cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil 
1314	the photochemical exchange in the gas phase 
1315	there are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment 
1316	space probes have yielded little information 
1317	being based on so few events these results are of dubious validity 
1318	to what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown 
1319	biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon 
1320	this area is highly susceptible to infection 
1321	there are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne 
1322	this may be of overriding importance in considering military objectives 
1323	lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus 
1324	it is a happy buzzing crowd 
1325	quite often honeybees form a majority on the willow catkins 
1326	the larvae kept warm by the queen are full grown in about ten days 
1327	sometimes although by no means always these are indeed alkaline 
1328	it is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves 
1329	this birth length seems to be typical 
1330	the lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood 
1331	no fasciculations or sensory defects were found 
1332	thyroid function tests yielded normal results 
1333	x ray films of the vertebral column showed progression of the demineralization 
1334	microscopically there was emphysema fibrosis and vascular congestion 
1335	inflammatory cells were strikingly absent 
1336	these were thought to represent regenerating fibers 
1337	this was chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells 
1338	no antigen was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells 
1339	of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect 
1340	the shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance 
1341	marksmanship example 
1342	before deriving this formula we explain what we mean by problems of this kind 
1343	we now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments 
1344	experiment without a fixed number of trials 
1345	toss a die until an ace appears 
1346	consider couples visiting an art museum 
1347	again the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist 
1348	a universe is a safe and permanent home 
1349	this explains some group ends and provides a justification of their primacy 
1350	it gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action 
1351	religion fosters group life in various ways 
1352	as such it acts as an anchor for the people 
1353	these needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension 
1354	within the larger social system are the structural and functional subsystems 
1355	regulative norms governing subgroups and roles 
1356	the problem of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values 
1357	the population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger 
1358	but the information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading 
1359	in short scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling 
1360	it provides a frame for the sampling census 
1361	but in this one section we welcomed auditors 
1362	after that we began to get visitors to class 
1363	some of these speculations may have some merit others are somewhat ambiguous 
1364	but within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible 
1365	or how do we enrich our already fine marriage 
1366	our campus unfortunately owns no films 
1367	the battery median grade equivalent was used in data analysis in this study 
1368	the batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three 
1369	he admitted his behavior and defended it 
1370	we may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment

1811	presently his water brother said breathlessly 
1812	eternity is no time for recriminations 
1813	you too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me 
1814	afterwards you did well enough 
1815	mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches 
1816	anyhow it was high time the boy was salted 
1817	my beloved ward my perennial gadfly said the whining voice 
1818	fuming helpless he watched them pass him 
1819	he rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw 
1820	a range of bluffs hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss 
1821	these planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere 
1822	but to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of them did 
1823	sonic electronic galvanic all blank 
1824	positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark 
1825	he wasn't likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever 
1826	it looks like we did when we made blastdown 
1827	maybe it would work the other way 
1828	actually they said he did sleep but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot 
1829	his body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispel fatigue poisons 
1830	the buddies invariably took advantage of him 
1831	behind him his mates stirred without waking 
1832	you're right now buddy 
1833	why pick me for your patsy 
1834	why accuse a shipmate of being behind this 
1835	the tapes show that 
1836	there's still such a thing as mental illness 
1837	her hum became a gurgle of surprise 
1838	the lady's eyes unmagnified bugged out 
1839	you people don't have adjustable vision 
1840	the good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time 
1841	she found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy 
1842	when she awoke she was the ship 
1843	she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner 
1844	hello anyone at home 
1845	the sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive 
1846	the many bodied girl lay near him 
1847	she radiated warmth and good fellowship 
1848	we can die too we can die like real people 
1849	he remembered them well from his happy period 
1850	a good morrow to you my boy 
1851	you mean a game with cards 
1852	soon said the half man 
1853	thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and new ones arrived 
1854	he remembered the last time he had eaten actual eggs from an actual pan 
1855	people never live forever 
1856	her eyes were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him 
1857	no girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him 
1858	she drank greedily and murmured thank you as he lowered her head 
1859	we'll work for our keep the boy said eagerly 
1860	we're not drunkards she said 
1861	my dress needs some work on it 
1862	we'll pay you back if you'll let us 
1863	we haven't slept together since we started 
1864	don't you hate me any more 
1865	now there's nothin left of me 
1866	thirty five they rode at a measured pace through the valley 
1867	then at last the darkness began to dissolve 
1868	they neither gained nor fell back 
1869	he rode low on the mare's neck 
1870	a bayonet hung in a belt scabbard 
1871	the guerrilla bivouac remained silent 
1872	he kissed her also and with deep tenderness 
1873	running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock 
1874	he might say or do something foolish 
1875	they were tethered army style on stable lines 
1876	a voice spoke near at hand 
1877	there's no chance now of all of us getting away 
1878	you'll have to try it alone 
1879	that touched off a total stampede 
1880	he picked up the powder canister and ran out 
1881	powder flame gushed beneath the wagon 
1882	guerrillas were racing toward him 
1883	some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak 
1884	the wagons were burning fiercely 
1885	the mudwagon had caught fire also 
1886	the roof of the command post began to buckle 
1887	anything wrong cap'n 
1888	there's no war on now 
1889	his legs pumped furiously his long black hair streamed out behind him 
1890	although my shot killed his horse he rolled off the bale on top of me 
1891	his eyes were dark fluid fearful and he gave a sigh as my knife went in 
1892	you could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size 
1893	it took him a long time to compose himself 
1894	my father ran him off here six years ago 
1895	it might hurt you though 
1896	and he was handsome despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek 
1897	she seemed irritated 
1898	you've got no business up here 
1899	you took me by surprise 
1900	there would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief 
1901	a warm breeze played across it moving it like waves 
1902	the pulsing glow of a cigarette 
1903	when he saw me coming he turned his radio off 
1904	when suitably lighted what would it look like 
1905	meanwhile spring had passed well into summer 
1906	they had chosen this night purposely 
1907	bury those uniforms so they won't be found 
1908	after another long pause he asked how many people know who they are 
1909	fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt 
1910	he lived and breathed for the mining company 
1911	ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches 
1912	it cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them 
1913	the gunman nodded slipping the picture into his breast pocket saying nothing 
1914	as she drove she thought about her plan 
1915	it was there that she would have to enact her renunciation beg forgiveness 
1916	perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream 
1917	nevertheless she continued to move upward 
1918	it circled her thighs exploring with its icy tentacles 
1919	every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy 
1920	lips pursed mournfully he stared down at its crazily sagging left side 
1921	and his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance 
1922	or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar 
1923	what did you mean by that rattlesnake gag 
1924	getting the boss rattlesnake to help you 
1925	so what's this all about 
1926	why single me out on this permit deal 
1927	you do that or take you out a permit right now 
1928	not immediately as the deputy demanded 
1929	oil field workers were a rough tough lot 
1930	a rabbit punch redoubled him 
1931	no more could he defend himself against them 
1932	why he's going to kill me he thought wildly 
1933	beat me to death in front of a hundred people 
1934	wait a little while 
1935	in my place you'd follow such advice as you give me 
1936	we'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck 
1937	they were all good men 
1938	lighted windows glowed jewel bright through the downpour 
1939	put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked 
1940	he was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain 
1941	we'll talk over at your office 
1942	it was secured by an oversized padlock 
1943	for the unseen ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time 
1944	the former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken 
1945	privately he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin 
1946	the rustling problem was by no means solved 
1947	there were no tracks of either hoofs or boots 
1948	he moistened his lips uneasily 
1949	who told you to do it 
1950	does this make it any easier coward 
1951	he wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble 
1952	we're going someplace 
1953	where're you takin' me 
1954	honey he whispered 
1955	like enough we'll all be up on top by sundown 
1956	a single kick made it spring open shuddering 
1957	clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter with growing alarm 
1958	his first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing 
1959	he had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind 
1960	a slug had torn half of his stirrup guard away 
1961	a second twitched his shirtsleeve and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm 
1962	another snarled close overhead 
1963	each plane carried two five hundred pound bombs 
1964	the pilots' heads looked ridiculously small 
1965	if the other pilots were worried they did not show it 
1966	although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity 
1967	twelve o'clock level 
1968	the opposing aircraft continued to come on 
1969	if any of us miss they can pick up the pieces 
1970	the clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around 
1971	let's take 'em home 
1972	perfect he thought 
1973	the enemy did not veer 
1974	as if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them 
1975	a large piece of engine cowling vanished 
1976	wingman stay clear he prayed 
1977	he fought the panic of vertigo 
1978	something pulled my leg 
1979	we were off the road gleaming barbed wire pulling taut 
1980	high so it only bounce harmlessly but loudly off a car's steel roof 
1981	on unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash 
1982	two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing 
1983	brakes shrieked behind us 
1984	and what eyes they were 
1985	eyes like hot honey eyes that sizzled 
1986	what's your name anyway 
1987	anyway it was evident what he had in mind 
1988	how's it strike you foul or fair 
1989	accident murder suicide take your pick 
1990	how will we work it out 
1991	lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks and having a ball 
1992	or more rhythmically the swarthy witches are laughing 
1993	should she wake him 
1994	so if all these beers was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot of money 
1995	he blew his nose expertly between his fingers 
1996	you shall see her at dinner 
1997	like as if it were built of books 
1998	she took it grudgingly her dark eyes baleful as they met his 
1999	she asked smolderingly 
2000	we can get it if we dig he said patiently 
2001	we're lost and burning up already she bit out tensely 
2002	they'll roll off in another day 
2003	in a way he couldn't blame her 
2004	she had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder 
2005	he had left her inviolate thinking familiarity would gentle her in time 
2006	his blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead 
2007	to his puzzlement there suddenly was no haze 
2008	he swung up over the wheel 
2009	the clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel 
2010	the cloudburst cut off abruptly 
2011	at least the wheels dug in 
2012	his wife didn't give a sign she'd heard 
2013	they were already swollen to bursting 
2014	sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of 
2015	the lifeboats were stuck fast 
2016	heave on those ropes the boat's come unstuck 
2017	let's hope we come to a safer place 
2018	they were shattered 
2019	later you shall know it better 
2020	the old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood 
2021	then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think 
2022	what outfit does she drive for 
2023	nowadays we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish 
2024	they don't go for bull like muscle as a rule 
2025	he didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself 
2026	the great black leopards 
2027	they came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools 
2028	he took his mask from his forehead and threw it unexpectedly across the deck 
2029	a note of awe came into his voice 
2030	our boy didn't chicken out no sir 
2031	whatever you tell him he will dive 
2032	he took a big swig of his drink 
2033	it would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this 
2034	make it come off all right 
2035	he felt a good deal less shaky 
2036	as his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand 
2037	he crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed 
2038	he murmured to himself with firmness no surrender 
2039	his superiors had also preached this saying it was the way for eternal honor 
2040	his comrades were all dead 
2041	the shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound 
2042	you came well equipped to die 
2043	are you a thrower of flame marine 
2044	wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film 
2045	before much longer the marine quieted down 
2046	he straightened up alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer 
2047	stay right here where you are kid he called 
2048	the kid has no manners boys 
2049	shall we teach him some 
2050	a third shot doused the light 
2051	he'll shoot up the town 
2052	the entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn 
2053	he sized up the situation and shook his head 
2054	he slipped outside hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways 
2055	can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow 
2056	all that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body 
2057	he strolled back to the door whistling softly hands still clasped behind him 
2058	why ain't you playin' ball 
2059	they played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap 
2060	thank you she said dusting herself off 
2061	maybe some other day 
2062	oh shucks the girl said 
2063	to his surprise his plan worked perfectly 
2064	he was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race 
2065	lifting her skirts she climbed in never relinquishing her grip on his arm 
2066	he saw a pint sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head 
2067	yeah seems so don't it the boy laughed hugging her close 
2068	we don't know this guy 
2069	his head came up and he said it defiantly 
2070	come sit he repeated motioning to the piled hay bags over the pig leavings 
2071	yeah but what're we gonna eat 
2072	he reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners 
2073	he ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid three dogs on the tin foil 
2074	how come you're riding the rods kids like you 
2075	now forget all this other 
2076	you gonna give me a drink fella 
2077	maybe you and me will girlie but these two ain't goin' nowhere 
2078	or the bay of female dogs in heat 
2079	they had slapped their thighs 
2080	he would not carry a brief case 
2081	all the while she sat there her sinewy arms swirled before her chest 
2082	you're boiling milk ain't you 
2083	above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud 
2084	what about a tea room then 
2085	she was so beautiful so valiant so pitiable 
2086	absolution for his lie 
2087	why lacerate the congregation 
2088	he'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been 
2089	if he ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame 
2090	he swung in through his own wide gateway 
2091	no temptation no virtue 
2092	go change your shoes before you turn around 
2093	he then offered his own estimate of the weather which was unenthusiastic 
2094	he scowled at her flowers 
2095	my dad did it and he lived to a great age 
2096	ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man 
2097	left mine many a time only she never knew it 
2098	he gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly 
2099	but she suffered in her off duty hours 
2100	then after a while she went to her mirror 
2101	just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didn't know 
2102	he may not rise to the heights but he can get by and eventually be retired 
2103	see you in about an hour 
2104	ahah he thought a lush divorcee at last 
2105	it gave her a lewd winking effect 
2106	our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics 
2107	it sounded silly why go on 
2108	don't forget whiskey it's such a big seller 
2109	she looked crestfallen as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race 
2110	with any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot 
2111	but roulette's not my game 
2112	he's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully 
2113	how's your luck honey 
2114	stake me she said and let me at those dice 
2115	named after the ballet 
2116	is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense 
2117	he saw the dangers not the glories of being identified as a mutineer 
2118	there is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners 
2119	the instinct to discipline has been lost 
2120	he paused then added everything on a ship is a weapon 
2121	another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist 
2122	now the hope was gone 
2123	this tragic lad had forged his own shackles 
2124	the air smelled warmish and foul 
2125	his black hat with its wide brim high crown and fur trim rode high 
2126	one white hand poised a stick above his desk 
2127	the guttural language from the ghetto stopped 
2128	some of them ignored the text and had apparently memorized the words long ago 
2129	his body pitched back and forth on the bench 
2130	does this bother you 
2131	you had to be stupid or crazy or immortal 
2132	she took it with her wherever she went she chose it 
2133	here they did not need to be in ghettos 
2134	all his family was dead except for his son 
2135	you feel him every mile further away 
2136	each of us had his own specialty besides 
2137	the eye is all inward or outward 
2138	why should this suddenly assail her 
2139	then the telephoning began 
2140	was it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks 
2141	it was nobody's fault 
2142	she overplayed her hand 
2143	why put such a high value on being top dog 
2144	why are you trying to worry me 
2145	was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance 
2146	but it was a hopeful sign he told himself 
2147	when they got home at midnight she was tired out 
2148	look somewhere else 
2149	let's be fine superior people of great dignity he said as if he were joking 
2150	then he fled not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry 
2151	he sank back sighing and was soon asleep again 
2152	his fingers fumbled across the bandages 
2153	he recognized his jacket and trousers 
2154	she must have put his clothes in the closet 
2155	he was kneeling to tie his shoelaces 
2156	his fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy 
2157	who would take over 
2158	for a moment he felt like a thief discovered 
2159	her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight 
2160	he had never felt particularly close to her 
2161	forget we ever knew what 
2162	his voice seemed thick and purposeless 
2163	are you positive you'll be all right by yourself 
2164	take care of yourself then 
2165	no really right as rain 
2166	look sweetheart some fool was 
2167	a smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape 
2168	they make us conformists look good 
2169	upstairs busy feet showering like raindrops pattered around her room 
2170	his dark brows which had been lowered in anger smoothed 
2171	how long would it be occupied 
2172	strength began to zip up and down his chest 
2173	he wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks 
2174	aw shut up he said 
2175	shivering he put on his clothes 
2176	watch it big shot a hoarse voice yelled back 
2177	she was holding on to his rock with one hand 
2178	her cough sounded like cloth ripping 
2179	my mother never wops me 
2180	she spouted a mouthful of water into the air 
2181	part collie part wire haired terrier 
2182	naturally curly hair runs in my family 
2183	books are for schnooks 
2184	either that or a veterinarian 
2185	she said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward 
2186	her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough 
2187	he daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around 
2188	he says he'll be here on the one o'clock plane 
2189	you saw them always together those years 
2190	now you know she could've but she isn't that kind of girl 
2191	she didn't even give me a chance to refuse 
2192	but now she looked ugly 
2193	now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough 
2194	he had fallen into a soft job and now the job was gone and he was stranded 
2195	virus infection nothing she'd scream at him 
2196	a profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at 
2197	the ward was a small one four beds kept reserved for female alcoholics 
2198	but if she wasn't interested she'd just go back to the same life she'd left 
2199	will you tell me why 
2200	she went on disregarding my protests 
2201	just let me die in peace 
2202	a long long way down 
2203	the reasons for this dive seemed foolish now 
2204	pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick 
2205	she saw me and sat down beside me three feet away 
2206	not good looking but self confident and wise so that it made her attractive 
2207	as we ate we talked 
2208	yes because you didn't run off to use that new toothbrush 
2209	a bullet she answered 
2210	no return address whatsoever 
2211	he was full of heavy family reminiscence 
2212	the rides were tame enough mostly we talked 
2213	somebody with no vices 
2214	and never show my face or my truck around here again 
2215	it was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced 
2216	it's never wrong if love is real 
2217	he'd not only told me so he'd proved it 
2218	no price is too high when true love is at stake 
2219	share bath maybe but share refrigerator 
2220	the red pills are a vitamin and iron compound 
2221	this is a sleeping capsule 
2222	you young men get to be my age you won't take flu so lightly 
2223	in these damp circumstances he was an odds on bet to develop pneumonia 
2224	fine day after tomorrow she added 
2225	run down iron poor 
2226	but then redheads are often pale 
2227	you're having a miserable time aren't you 
2228	suppose what's his name got a sunburn 
2229	how's your sunburn now 
2230	when he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in 
2231	they were both walking towards each other unhurried 
2232	fights sprang up and were quickly squelched 
2233	why the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me 
2234	nobody else did either 
2235	you don't belong in professional baseball 
2236	now don't tell me what a good ball player you are 
2237	baseball's no cinch 
2238	his lips felt glued together 
2239	the leagues are full of guys like that 
2240	why not try another club 
2241	he needs outfielders bad 
2242	twenty two or twenty three 
2243	snakes are ugly he said again 
2244	nobody likes snakes 
2245	he could take the advice or leave it 
2246	real bright along those lines you might say 
2247	weakness in leadership 
2248	she always could sense the shag end of a woolly day 
2249	did you know he is advertising his ham radio equipment for sale this weekend 
2250	all your wishful thinking won't change that 
2251	he had always been a messy and negligent man 
2252	half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things 
2253	more he could take at leisure
